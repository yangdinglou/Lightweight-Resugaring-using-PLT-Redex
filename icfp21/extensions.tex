\section{Extensions}
\label{sec:ext}

So far, we have introduced our approach with the basic setting. We have shown exciting results with the simple but novel lazy desugaring. Also, we found our approach has good because of the few restriction. In this section, we will give two possible extensions of the basic approach. Just as the \m{DisplayableExp} can make the output convenient, The flexibility of our approach is another good feature when considering the diverse application.

\subsection{Model Assumption and A Black-Box Extension}


As mentioned in the introduction (Section \ref{mark:mention}), our approach assumes a more specific model (evaluation rules) compared to the existing approach (black-box stepper). There is a small gap between the motivation of the existing approach and ours---the existing approach focuses mainly on a tool for existing language, while our approach considers more on a meta-level feature for language implementation. Some examples in the previous section has shown how lazy desugaring solves some problems in practice.

In addition, as what we need for the lazy desugaring is basically to decide the computational order of the syntactic sugar, we can make an extension for the resugaring algorithm to work with a black-box core language stepper. The most important difference between the black-box stepper and the evaluation rules is the computational order---while the same language behaves uniquely, the evaluation rules can show the computational order statically (without running the program). So when meeting the black-box stepper for the core language, we can use some simple program to "get" the computational order of the core language as the following example shows: we simply let the sub-expressions of a \m{Head} be some reducible expressions and test the computational order.

\begin{center}
	\Code{(if $\m{tmpe}_1$ $\m{tmpe}_2$ $\m{tmpe}_3$)}\\ $\Downarrow_{stepper}$\\ \Code{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\;(if $\m{tmpe}_1$' $\m{tmpe}_2$ $\m{tmpe}_3$)} \note{//getting a context rule}\\ $\Downarrow_{getnext}$\\ \Code{(if $\m{tmpv}_1$ $\m{tmpe}_2$ $\m{tmpe}_3$)}\\ $\Downarrow_{stepper}$\\ \qquad\Code{$\m{tmpe}_i$}\note{//no more rules}\\
\end{center}


But that is not enough---the core language and the surface language cannot be mixed easily because of the lack of evaluation rules for the core language. We should do the same try during the evaluation to make the core language's stepper useful when meeting some surface language's expression. Here we give a dynamic one-step reduction of the mixed language. Note that here we only define the reduction for unnested syntactic sugar for convenience. It is easy to extend to nested sugar (but so huge to express).

\end{figure*}

Putting them in words. For expression \Code{(SurfHead $e_1$ $\ldots$ $e_n$)}, as we discussed in Section \ref{mark:correct}, only reduction on the $e_i$ of the sugar's $LHS$ will not destroy the $RHS$'s form. So we can just take a try after the expansion of \m{SurfHead}.

For an expression \Code{(CoreHead $e_1$ $\ldots$ $e_n$)}  whose sub-expressions contain \m{SurfExp}, replacing all \m{SurfExp} sub-expressions with any reducible core language's expression $\m{tmpe}_i$ . Then getting a result after inputting the new expression $e'$ to the original black-box stepper. Then two possible cases come.

If reduction appears at a sub-expression at $\m{tmpe}_i$'s location, then the stepper with the extension should return \Code{(CoreHead $e_1$ $\ldots$ $e_i'$ $\ldots$ $e_n$)}, where $e_i'$ is $e_i$ after the mixed language's one-step reduction ($\redm{}{}$) as the following example (rule $\mathtt{CoreExt1}$)
\begin{center}
	\Code{(if (and e1 e2) (or e1 e2) \#f)}\\ $\Downarrow_{replace}$\\ \Code{(if (not \#t) (not \#t) \#f)}\\ $\;\;\Downarrow_{blackbox}$\\ \Code{(if \#f (not \#t) \#f)}\\ $\quad\Downarrow_{reduction}$\\ \Code{(if (if e1 e2 \#f) (or e1 e2) \#f)}
\end{center}
Otherwise (no reduction on $\m{tmp}_i$), the stepper should return \Code{$e'$}, with all the replaced sub-expressions replacing back (rule $\mathtt{CoreExt2}$).
\begin{center}
	\Code{(if \#t (and ...) (or ...))}\\ $\Downarrow_{replace}$ \\\Code{ (if \#t $\m{tmpe}_2$ $\m{tmpe}_3$)}\\ $\;\;\Downarrow_{blackbox}$\\  \Code{$\m{tmpe}_2$}\\ $\quad\;\;\;\Downarrow_{replaceback}$\\ \Code{(and ...)}
\end{center}
We call the extension "one-step-try", because it tries one step on the expression in the black-box stepper. The extension will not violate the properties of the original core language's evaluator. It is obvious that the evaluator with the extension will reduce at the sub-expression as it needs in the core language, if the reduction appears in a sub-expression. The stepper with extension behaves the same as mixing the evaluation rules of the core language and desugaring rules of surface language.

Some other processes are needed during \m{CoreExt2}. For a program \Code{(let (x 2) (Sugar x y))} as an example, it should reduce to \Code{(Sugar 2 y)} by the $\redm{}{}$, but got \Code{(Sugar x y)} if the \m{CoreExt2} rule does not consider the binding and substitution. When using the extension of black-box stepper's rule, we need some other information about in which sub-expression a substitution will occur. Then for these sub-expressions, we need to do the same substitution before replacing back. The substitution can be got by a similar idea as the dynamic reduction in our simple core language's setting. For example, we know the third sub-expression of an expression headed with \m{let} is to be substituted. We should first try \Code{(let (x 2) x)}, \Code{(let (x 2) y)} in one-step reduction to get the substitution [2/x], then, getting \Code{(Sugar 2 y)}.

Then for any sugar expression, we can process them dynamically by "one-step-try" like the example in Fig.  \ref{example:try}. (The bold \m{Head} means trying on this expression.)

\subsection{Side effect}


The side effect is a special issue in resugaring. In the previous section, we described the core language as a purely functional language, but side effects are allowed according to the algorithm. Since the computational order calculated is correct, side effects do not matter if we only consider the evaluation result. But the actual issue is the output of resugaring sequences. Assuming that the core language can process side effects by adding an environment, with a \m{set} expression changing a value of a variable (returning void), and a \m{begin} expression evaluating all sub-expressions and returning the last result in the core language for using the environment.

% If \Code{(begin e ...)} has the context rules
% \[
% 	{\footnotesize
% 	\begin{array}{lcl}
% 		\Code{C}&:==&\Code{(\m{begin~C})}\\
% 		& | &\Code{(\m{begin~C~e~$\ldots$})}\\
% 		& | &[\bigcdot]
% 	\end{array}
% 	}
% \]
% and reduction rules
% \[
% {\footnotesize
% 		\begin{array}{lcl}
% 		\Code{(begin~$\m{v}_1$~$\m{e}_2$~...)} &\redc{}{}& \Code{(begin~$\m{e}_2$~...)}\\
% 		\Code{(begin~v)} &\redc{}{}& \Code{v}\\
% 		\end{array}
% }
% \]
Given a syntactic sugar
\[\drule{\Code{(inc x y)}}{\Code{(begin (set x (+ x y)) x)}}\]
and for the expression \Code{(let (x 1) (inc x (+ 1 1)))}, we will have the following evaluation sequences in the core language (omitted the desugaring process).
\[
	\begin{array}{l}
		\qquad\;\Code{(let (x 1) (begin (set x (+ x (+ 1 1))) x))}\\
	\redc{}{}\Code{(begin (set x (+ x (+ 1 1))) x) [x:1]} \qquad//{\scriptsize\emph{resugar to \Code{(inc x (+ 1 1))}}}\\
	\redc{}{}\Code{(begin (set x (+ 1 (+ 1 1))) x) [x:1]} \\
	\redc{}{}\Code{(begin (set x (+ 1 2)) x) [x:1]} \qquad//{\scriptsize\emph{resugar to \Code{(inc x 2)}}?}\\
	\redc{}{}\ldots
	\end{array}
\]

In the sequences, we would see the \m{x} in \Code{(+ x (+ 1 1)} was reduced to $1$ getting from the environment. But other \m{x} in the program cannot be replaced. So as we described in Section \ref{mark:suflang}, resugaring for such sugar needs some special judgements. Because we add \m{set} expression in the core language, the issue cannot be solved by a let binding (the \m{x} in RHS is always a reducible expression).
Another issue happened when the sub-expression \Code{(set x (+ 1 (+ 1 1)))} reduced to \Code{(set x (+ 1 2))}. As the \m{1} was reduced from \m{x}, we could record it and made the whole expression resugar to \Code{(inc x 2)}. Based on the issues above, an extension that marking the variable (which may appear at the first sub-expression of \m{set} expression) can make it. During the \m{calcontext} function, we can simply ignore the \m{x} as a possible hole for the sugar \m{inc}. So we could get the context rule
\[
	{\small
	\begin{array}{lcl}
		\Code{C}&::=&\Code{(inc x C)}\\
		& | &[\bigcdot]
	\end{array}
	}
\]

But there is still another issue. If we want to make use of the side effect, things like \m{begin} expression in core language are needed. But such expressions are not suitable for the resugaring at all. For example, given a syntactic sugar
\[\drule{\Code{(inc2 x y z)}}{\Code{(begin (set x (+ y x)) (set x (+ z x)) x)}}\]
and for the following expression \Code{(let (x 1) (inc2 x (+ 1 1) (+ 1 1)))}, once the first \m{set} expression was reduced to \m{void}, the \m{inc2} sugar will not have a chance for resugaring. If a syntactic sugar has more pattern variables, the process will lose more intermediate information. The same case happened in the existing approach\cite{resugaring}'s \m{letrec} example, which did not get any intermediate resugaring sequences.

Overall, our approach can make an extension for a core language with side effects. But the lesson we get is that the pure functional language is better for resugaring.
