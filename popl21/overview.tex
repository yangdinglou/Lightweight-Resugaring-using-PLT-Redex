Use a simple but sharp example to give an overview of your approach.

\subsection{Defination of resugaring}
This subsection is partially similiar to original defination in\cite{resugaring}.
\begin{Def}[Resugaring]
Given core language (named {\bfseries CoreLang}) and its evalation rules, together with surface language based on syntactic sugars of CoreLang (named {\bfseries Surflang}). For any expression of Surflang, getting the evaluation sequences of the expression in terms of SurfLang. 
\end{Def}
For correctness of the resugaring, the evaluation sequences should maintain the following three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bfseries Emulation} Each term in the generated surface evaluation sequence desugars into the core term which it is meant to represent.
\item {\bfseries Abstraction} The resugaring sequences should only contains terms in SurfLang, and each term of SurfLang should originate from initial expression.
\item {\bfseries Coverage} No sequence is skipped during the process.
\end{enumerate}

Given an example below.

For syntactic sugar {\bfseries and} and {\bfseries or}, the sugar rules are:
\begin{center}
	\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{%
		\begin{center}  
			and(e1, e2) → if(e1, e2, \#f)\\
			or(e1, e2) → if(e1, \#t, e2)
		\end{center}  
	}%  
\end{center}
which forms a simple SurfLang.

The evaluation rules of {\bfseries if} is:
\begin{center}
	\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{%
		\begin{center}  
			if(\#t, e1, e2) → e1\\
			if(\#f, e1, e2) → e2
		\end{center}  
	}% 
\end{center}

Then for SurfLang's expression
