\begin{abstract}


Syntactic sugar, first coined by Peter J. Landin in 1964, has proved to be very useful for defining domain-specific languages and extending languages. Unfortunately, when syntactic sugar is eliminated by transformation, it obscures the relationship between the userâ€™s source program and the transformed program. Resugaring is a powerful technique to resolve this problem, which automatically converts the evaluation sequences of desugared expression in the core language into representative sugar's syntax in the surface language. However, the traditional approach relies on reverse application of desugaring rules to desugared core expression whenever possible. When a desugaring rule is complex and a desugared expression is large, such reverse desugaring becomes very complex  and costive.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to resugaring by lazy desugaring, where reverse application of desugaring rules is unnecessary. We recognize a sufficient and necessary condition for a syntactic sugar to be desugared, and propose a reduction strategy, based on evaluator of the core languages and the desugaring rules, which can  produce all necessary resugared terms on the surface language. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be made more efficient by automatic derivation of evaluation rules for syntactic sugars. We have implemented a system based on this new approach. Compared to the traditional approach, the new approach is not only more efficient, but also more powerful in that it cannot only deal with all cases (such as hygienic and simple recursive sugars) published so far, but can do more allowing more flexible recursive sugars.
