%Explain the work that are related to your problem, and to your three contributions. 

The most related work is the series of resugaring\cite{resugaring,hygienic,resugaringtype,resugaringscope}. The first two work is about resugaring evaluation sequences, the third one is about resugaring scope rules, and the last one is about resugaring type rules. The whole series is for better syntactic sugar. Our approach considered to implement a method for better DSLs, then regarded core language and surf language as a whole language.

Macrofiction\cite{Macrofication} is for generating macros for programs automatically to refactor the codes. Our work may try resugaring some macros generated automatically to test the practicality of resugaring method. Since the setup of our tools is simple, it will be easy to intergrate the two tools.

Galois slicing for Imperative Functional Programs\cite{slicing} is a work for analyzing functional programs during execution. Our approach used a similiar idea on slicing programs and processing on sub-programs.
