%Summarize the paper, explaining what you have shown, what results you have achieved, and what future work is.

In this paper, we purpose an efficient, powerful, and lightweight resugaring approach by lazy desugaring. Essentially, we would see the derivation of evaluation rules is the abstract of the basic resugaring approach. In the basic resugaring approach, the most important part is \emph{reduction in mixed language} (see in sec \ref{mark:mixedreduction}), which decides whether reducing the subexpression or desugaring the outermost sugar. Reducing subexpressions are just the same as derivate context rules; desugaring the outermost sugar is similar to derivate reduction rules. The derivate evaluation rules, if can be got, is more convenient and efficient than the basic resugaring, because the derivation evolves a process like abstract interpretation\cite{AbstractInterpretation}, then reduces many steps executed in core language. Moreover, the semantics got by derivation make it possible to do some optimization at the surface language level, which is important for implementing a DSL. However, the derivation method has more restrictions than our basic resugaring approach, so not powerful enough to handle all cases that can be processed by the resugaring. So we use the derivate rules as a shortcut for our basic resugaring.

As for the future work, we found side effect is troublesome to handle in resugaring, because once a side effect is taken in RHS of a syntactic sugar, the sugar can not be resugared according to \emph{emulation} property. We need to find a gentler way to handle sugars with side effects. In addition, we found the derivation of evaluation rules can be a general method to be used on other application (e.g. implementing DSL). But the constraints of IFA in our setting limit the expressiveness. So we may be achieving a more powerful derivation as future work.
